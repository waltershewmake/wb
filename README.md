## About
This project is a monorepo for my new SaaS startup idea: an ultra-customizable, drag-and-drop website builder for developers. Developers will be able to write their own React components to use in the drag-and-drop editor.

### Motivation
When I was first getting into web design, I was looking for something like this. I wanted a simple and easy way to build a website admin panel for my sites that were developer friendly, but also great for the average user too. This product will aim to do just that.

### Target
The target market is people like me: developers who are looking for a fast & powerful, yet easy-to-use admin panel for their websites. This product is not for the average consumer directly, but instead for a developer that markets his or her own website to the average consumer.

### Competitors
There's a little bit of competition out there already but not a complete package like this will be. There are tons of “headless CMS” companies out there that are offering something similar. There are also tons of drag-and-drop builders. This product stands out because it isn’t just a headless CMS. You can use your own React components in our drag-and-drop editor. On top of that, it’s also an extremely functional admin panel after the developer has done the initial building of the site. This means he/she can add his/her client to the site to edit the content after he/she is done with the initial build.

### Goals
With this project, I have three main goals.
1. **Easy to Use APIs**
	- Secure and easy to use with extensive documentation.
2. **Beautiful & Functional Design**
	- Design so intuitive your grandma can use it.
	- Extensive documentation & features available to the developer.
	- Public extension library so all developers can create custom functionality
3. **Save Time**
	- If this project does one thing, I want it to save you, *the developer*, time. I did it the hard way, and I don't want anyone else to go through what I did. That's why I'm creating this software.

I hope that I can achieve all of this by Jan 15th, my projected launch date. Although all features—like the public extension library—may not be present, I will have a working version by then.
